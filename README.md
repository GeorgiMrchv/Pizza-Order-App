# Pizza-Order-App

A sample project developed using ASP.NET Web Forms technology for a certain University discipline. The idea behind the app is to order a pizza. There are three roles - delivery guy, shop owner, client. Delivery guys only sees the last orders and knows which address needs to be visit. Shop owner can change images of the pizza's and prices. Client can see a list of items (pizza items) and choose which one he wants as well as add a note.
